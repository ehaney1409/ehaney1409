After graduating from the University of Maryland College Park in August of 2020, I joined an eCommerce startup called Whitebox as a sales development representative. The startup was focused on eCommerce fulfillment and Amazon advertising, and in between the two, data science to help drive better decisions. This is where I first got excited about data science, and dipped my toe in the field by starting the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera in  November of 2020. Then, a friend recommended a watch the Robert Downey Jr. series "The Age of AI" on YouTube, which fueled my excitement for the field (if you haven't watched it, I highly recommend it). Then, after evaluating bootcamps and grad schools, I decided to head back to grad school to pursue an M.S. in Data Analytics at the University of Maryland Global Campus in January of 2021. Over the past year or so, have really enjoyed diving into the deep-end of the data science/analytics world and excited for what's next.

Below, you can check out some project I have worked on in grad school. When I am not working in grad school, you can find me swimming, biking, or running (training for my next half Ironman).
